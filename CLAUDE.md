# Check for lint/type errors (if available)
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
```

Note: This is a static site, so there may not be npm scripts available.

- The site owner is a young collector, so response times may be longer during school hours
- All actual transactions happen through eBay's platform
- The site serves primarily as a showcase and directory for the eBay store
